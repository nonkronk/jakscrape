# IT jackscrape - CS50x Final Project
IT Jakscrape is a web crawling engine based on Scrapy Framework that scrape/crawl an e-commerce site (https://jakartanotebook.com) and extract all the important informations of the website like product listing, stock, price, image, sku, color, rating, warranty, and etc into csv file or database.

> It scraped **17.749** product listings from the website including ALL the product images in several hours!
**(Macbook Pro + Indihome 30Mbps broadband)**

Thanks to David J. Malan and cs50 staff.
This was CS50.

On the next future I want to generate public REST API from it.
